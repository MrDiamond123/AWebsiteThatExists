# COPPA
## Introduction  
  YouTube was recently fined for violating _COPPA_, but what is COPPA? The “Childrens’ Online Privacy Protection Act” is a federal law enforced by the _FTC_ to prevent websites from stealing kids’ _(classified as anyone who is 13 and under)_ information without parental consent. This act, however, is controversial because of its strict guidelines, while some people are fine with its terms.
